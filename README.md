# **Overview**

This is a port of **jay_krow's** [Experimental library containing a lot of PvZ2 hooks](https://github.com/jaykrow/pvz2-experimental) for 9.8.

# **IMPORTANT**
None of this code follows best practices and several features are unfinished, so keep that in mind as you read through or if you use the implementation. For example, a lot of destructors aren't overridden so memory leaks can happen for a lot of custom types.

Credits to **jay_krow** for original project, **BreakfastBrainz2's** https://github.com/BreakfastBrainz2/PVZ2ExampleMod and also for a lot of his help, **WDH** and **PvZABFan** for facilitating testing environments for a lot of features.
